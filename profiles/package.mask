# This is an extra mask for hxt-8.5.0 to make sure we don't accidentally
# release it "into the wild" as it XPath and XSLT have been split off into
# hxt-xpath and hxt-xslt (neither of which have been added to the overlay yet).
# As such, some packages might not work with it.

# Mask RCs for testing.
# We're still working on supporting this, so expect that some things
# might not yet work.

# The great filepath removal!
# Core package, shouldn't upgrade it, blah, blah, blah.
# Users should manually re-build all packages that depend on it.
