# Bytestring is a GHC core lib; as such, upgrading it could result in diamond dependency problems.
# Also, there's no easy way to reliably rebuild all installed packages that require it.
# As such, all bytestring deps have been removed from all packages; this mask is here
# to let users know why, and in case something goes wrong...
# This will also make it easier to sync the tree with the overlay, as the tree doesn't have
# a bytestring package.
# If you have an upgraded version of bytestring installed, haskell-updater can help
# with rebuilding packages.
