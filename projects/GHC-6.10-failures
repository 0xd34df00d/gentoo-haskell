The following is a list of packages that don't build with ghc-6.10.* 
(note that this is _not_ packages that have unsatisfied dependencies)

gtk2hs (unknown)
hxt (needs base-3, arrows)
hackport-darcs (needs updating to Cabal 1.6)
<xmonad-0.8 (Exception handling)
xmobar{,-darcs} (changed syntax for GHC.Exception.Exception)
mkcabal (Exception handling)

Fixed issues:
happy # Overlay didn't contain latest version
tar # now works
darcs # latest rc works
