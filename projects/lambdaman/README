Lambdaman
=========

repoman equivalent but for the gentoo haskell overlay.

Checks for:
  * Missing ebuilds in the Manifests
  * Inconsistencies between the manifest checksum and ebuilds
  * Ebuilds that darcs does not know about but the Manifest do

Requires package SHA for digests.

Add the following lines to your _darcs/prefs/defaults:

  record prehook projects/lambdaman/run
  record run-prehook
