== Easy ==

* test the src-extralibs ebuilds with ghc-6.5.

* add blockers to all current ebuilds that don't build with ghc-6.5
  eg haddock-0.7

== High priority ==

== Ebuild maintainance ==

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium, hs-plugins, hsshellscript, hxt

* in the ghc ebuilds: does the ghcprof subst work

== New ebuilds ==

* add the following src-extralibs ebuilds for ghc6.5:
  - ALUT
  - GLUT
  - OpenAL
  - OpenGL

* add new version of happy for ghc6.6.

* hugs-2006.5

* haskelldb: though the current release is very old, perhaps prod them
  for a new release. The dev version supports HDBC I believe.

* crypto-3.0.3, in discussion with upstream about the newbinary dep

* ldap: fixing build bugs with upstream

* magic: http://quux.org/devel/magic-haskell
  note that debian has ver 1.0.3 but the current tarball is 1.0.1

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)
    An ebuild is in the overlay but it needs some more love.
    Only tested on x86.
    'hint' works with simple library and with type classes.
    The other executables only works with the simple library, type classes
    fail with:
    Using overloaded Prelude while overloading is not enabled
      Hint: Compile with --overloading, or use the simple Prelude

* darcsweb

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

* use the new virtuals system for virtual/ghc

* make use of the libraries profiling stuff (that's in the cabal eclass) for more lib ebuilds

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* get ghc bugs fixed upstream, send patches and get a propper fix for the exec
  stack problem.

* help fix & improve cabal:
  we need to be able to specify the libdir not just the prefix (lib/lib64)

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
