Gentoo Haskell TODO
*******************

Oh, hi!
So you've got a couple of moments to kill and you're looking for something
to do? You've come to the right place.

There are sereval ways to find tasks, one is looking in this TODO.
Another is to have a look at the bug reports piled up at the Gentoo
Bugzilla; see http://tinyurl.com/2l3p48
Anything from actually solving the problem to just verify the report or
provide more information is helpful.

To start contribute you need a working copy of the haskell overlay, a copy
that you can modify and send patches from. You could use layman to get a
copy, but in this case I'd not recommend it. Assuming you have darcs
emerged, run this to get your own copy of the repo:

    darcs get --partial http://haskell.org/~gentoo/gentoo-haskell/

You need to be able to create patches and possibly send them directly from
darcs, consult the darcs manual at http://darcs.net

Introduction to Haskell Ebuilds
===============================

We have two kinds of ebuilds, completely manually written, and those mostly
generated from hackage using our custom tool hackport.

Ebuilds for complex applications and libraries that take a little more care,
like ghc, are written by hand.

The absolutely mostpart though, are projects listed on the hackage site;
  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html
For all those packages we can generate ebuilds that often only require very
little manual tweeking. The dependencies, descriptions etc, written in the
.cabal files is used to correctly generate the ebuilds. The progress of
hackage and development decisions are important for gentoo haskell, which is
why we keep a close cooperation with them.

To get the hackport tool, either install app-portage/hackport-darcs
available from the haskell overlay, or get your copy of the repo using

  darcs get --partial http://haskell.org/~gentoo/hackport/

Next, lets see where your help is needed :)

== Easy ==

== High priority ==

== Ebuild maintainance ==

* remove hs-plugins from portage

* remove old versions of cabal. Do we need anything other than 1.1.6.2 and 1.2?

* extralibs in ghc-6.8.2. test if the work with ghc 6.6.1 too, and add them
  to portage. as package.masked for those who only work with ghc 6.8.2.
        ALUT            2.1.0.0
        GLUT            2.1.1.1
        HUnit           1.2.0.0
        ObjectIO        1.0.1.1
        OpenAL          1.3.1.1
        OpenGL          2.2.1.1
        QuickCheck      1.1.0.0
        cgi             3001.1.5.1
        fgl             5.4.1.1
        haskell-src     1.0.1.1
        html            1.0.1.1
        mtl             1.1.0.0
        network         2.1.0.0
        parallel        1.0.0.0
        parsec          2.1.0.0
        regex-base      0.72.0.1
        regex-compat    0.71.0.1
        regex-posix     0.72.0.2
        stm             2.1.1.0
        time            1.1.2.0
        xhtml           3000.0.2.1

* ask ppc arch team to get these marked ~ppc:
	glut-2.1.1
	openal-1.3.1
	opengl-2.2.1

* ask ppc64 arch team to get these marked ~ppc64:
	filepath-1.0
	regex-base-0.72
	regex-compat-0.71
	regex-posix-0.71

* ask hppa arch team to get these marked ~hppa:
	fgl-5.4.1
	haskell-src-1.0.1
	html-1.0.1
	hunit-1.1.1
	mtl-1.0.1
	network-2.0.1
	quickcheck-1.0.1
	time-1.1.1
	xhtml-3000.0.2

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium

* in the ghc ebuilds: does the ghcprof subst work?

== New ebuilds ==

* get regex-{base,compat,posix} ~arch on all platforms

* build binaries for ghc 6.6.1 for remaining platforms: alpha, ppc64

* all the new missingh packages: hslogger, ftphs, configfile, anydbm

* wash-2.12

* hugs-2006.5

* haskelldb: though the current release is very old, perhaps prod them
  for a new release. The dev version supports HDBC I believe.

* crypto-3.0.3, in discussion with upstream about the newbinary dep
                crypto will switch to the binary library once it has a bit
                layer

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)
    An ebuild is in the overlay but it needs some more love.
    Only tested on x86.
    'hint' works with simple library and with type classes.
    The other executables only works with the simple library, type classes
    fail with:
    Using overloaded Prelude while overloading is not enabled
      Hint: Compile with --overloading, or use the simple Prelude

* darcsweb

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* get ghc bugs fixed upstream, send patches

* help fix & improve cabal

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* Since there is no ghc-bin ebuild, do we really need /opt/ghc anymore? Can we just install to /usr 
  instead?
  ==> Looks like it's working fine with the 6.8 releases... port these changes back to older releases? Though 
      this may require re-stabilisation of the ebuilds in the official tree.

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
	=> is this just hackport?
