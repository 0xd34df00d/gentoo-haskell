* remove hs-plugins from portage

* remove old versions of cabal. Do we need anything other than 1.1.6.2?

* add latest X11 to portage (assuming it doesn't require latest cabal)

* ask for these to go stable:
	alut-2.0.1		amd64 x86
	arrows-0.2.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86
	cgi-3001.1.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86
	fgl-5.4.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	filepath-1.0		hppa ppc sparc ~ppc64
	glut-2.1.1		amd64 x86 ~ppc ~sparc
	haskell-src-1.0.1	amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	html-1.0.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	hunit-1.1.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	mtl-1.0.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	network-2.0.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	openal-1.3.1		amd64 x86 ~ppc ~sparc
	opengl-2.2.1		amd64 x86 ~ppc ~sparc
	quickcheck-1.0.1	amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	regex-base-0.72		ppc sparc ~ppc64
	regex-compat-0.71	ppc sparc ~ppc64
	regex-posix-0.71	ppc sparc ~ppc64
	time-1.1.1		amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa
	xhtml-3000.0.2		amd64 ppc sparc x86 ~hppa

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium

* in the ghc ebuilds: does the ghcprof subst work?

* update the x86 and amd64 ghc-bin-6.8.1 tarballs to reflect the proper location of the docs 
  (/usr/share/doc/ghc-6.8.1 instead of /usr/share/doc/ghc)

== New ebuilds ==

* new dev-haskell/ ebuilds from hackage that we should get into portage:
  - regex-*
  - xmonad

* get regex-{base,compat,posix} ~arch on all platforms

* build binaries for ghc 6.6.1 for remaining platforms: alpha, ppc64

* all the new missingh packages: hslogger, ftphs, configfile, anydbm

* wash-2.12

* hugs-2006.5

* haskelldb: though the current release is very old, perhaps prod them
  for a new release. The dev version supports HDBC I believe.

* crypto-3.0.3, in discussion with upstream about the newbinary dep
                crypto will switch to the binary library once it has a bit
                layer

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)
    An ebuild is in the overlay but it needs some more love.
    Only tested on x86.
    'hint' works with simple library and with type classes.
    The other executables only works with the simple library, type classes
    fail with:
    Using overloaded Prelude while overloading is not enabled
      Hint: Compile with --overloading, or use the simple Prelude

* darcsweb

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* get ghc bugs fixed upstream, send patches

* help fix & improve cabal

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* Since there is no ghc-bin ebuild, do we really need /opt/ghc anymore? Can we just install to /usr 
  instead?

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
