* remove hs-plugins from portage

* remove old versions of cabal. Do we need anything other than 1.1.6.2 and 1.2?

* extralibs in ghc-6.8.2. test if the work with ghc 6.6.1 too, and add them
  to portage. as package.masked for those who only work with ghc 6.8.2.

* ask ppc arch team to get these marked ~ppc:
	glut-2.1.1
	openal-1.3.1
	opengl-2.2.1

* ask ppc64 arch team to get these marked ~ppc64:
	filepath-1.0
	regex-base-0.72
	regex-compat-0.71
	regex-posix-0.71

* ask hppa arch team to get these marked ~hppa:
	fgl-5.4.1
	haskell-src-1.0.1
	html-1.0.1
	hunit-1.1.1
	mtl-1.0.1
	network-2.0.1
	quickcheck-1.0.1
	time-1.1.1
	xhtml-3000.0.2

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium

* in the ghc ebuilds: does the ghcprof subst work?

== New ebuilds ==

* get regex-{base,compat,posix} ~arch on all platforms

* build binaries for ghc 6.6.1 for remaining platforms: alpha, ppc64

* all the new missingh packages: hslogger, ftphs, configfile, anydbm

* wash-2.12

* hugs-2006.5

* haskelldb: though the current release is very old, perhaps prod them
  for a new release. The dev version supports HDBC I believe.

* crypto-3.0.3, in discussion with upstream about the newbinary dep
                crypto will switch to the binary library once it has a bit
                layer

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)
    An ebuild is in the overlay but it needs some more love.
    Only tested on x86.
    'hint' works with simple library and with type classes.
    The other executables only works with the simple library, type classes
    fail with:
    Using overloaded Prelude while overloading is not enabled
      Hint: Compile with --overloading, or use the simple Prelude

* darcsweb

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* get ghc bugs fixed upstream, send patches

* help fix & improve cabal

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* Since there is no ghc-bin ebuild, do we really need /opt/ghc anymore? Can we just install to /usr 
  instead?
  ==> Looks like it's working fine with the 6.8 releases... port these changes back to older releases? Though 
      this may require re-stabilisation of the ebuilds in the official tree.

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
	=> is this just hackport?
