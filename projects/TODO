== Easy ==

== High priority ==

== Ebuild maintainance ==

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium, hs-plugins, hsshellscript, hxt

* in the ghc ebuilds: does the ghcprof subst work

== New ebuilds ==

* new dev-haskell/ ebuilds from hackage that we should get into portage:
  - cpphs-1.3
  - regex-*
  - xmonad

* all the new missingh packages: hslogger, ftphs, configfile, anydbm

* wash-2.12

* hugs-2006.5

* haskelldb: though the current release is very old, perhaps prod them
  for a new release. The dev version supports HDBC I believe.

* crypto-3.0.3, in discussion with upstream about the newbinary dep
                crypto will switch to the binary library once it has a bit
                layer

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)
    An ebuild is in the overlay but it needs some more love.
    Only tested on x86.
    'hint' works with simple library and with type classes.
    The other executables only works with the simple library, type classes
    fail with:
    Using overloaded Prelude while overloading is not enabled
      Hint: Compile with --overloading, or use the simple Prelude

* darcsweb

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* get ghc bugs fixed upstream, send patches

* help fix & improve cabal

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
