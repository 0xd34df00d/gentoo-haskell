I'd like to call gentoo-haskell community to arms. We have a nice 
[wiki](http://wiki.gentoo.org) and our project page have moved [there](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Haskell).
But it seems that we don't have enough documentaion quality for end-user
application. As a developers we support proper builds and tests for that
packages but we are not expert users for many of them. So I'd like
to ask community to add some docs for applications you use. This basically
means installation, advanced configs (examples), interesting usecases, links
to externall resources (blog posts/documentation) and so on. It will can
help a lot for new gentoo users.

The most interesing projects are
  * [pandoc](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Pandoc)
  * [git-annex](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Git-annex)
  * [gitit](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gitit)
  * [yi](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/yi)
  * [xmonad](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xmonad)

Thanks!
