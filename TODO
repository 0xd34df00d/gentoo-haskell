Results of meeting 8/2/06:

== Easy ==

* remove ghc-6.4 (leaving 6.4.1-r2)

== High priority ==

* mark ghc-6.4.1 and ghc-bin-6.4.1 stable on all supported arches

== Ebuild maintainance ==

* get other ebuilds marked stable on as many arches as we can test:
  alex-2.0.1-r1, c2hs-0.14.5, cabal-1.1.3, drift-2.1.2, gtk2hs-0.9.10,
  haddock-0.7, happy-1.15, hugs98-2005.3-r2, buddha-1.2.

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium, hs-plugins, hsshellscript, hxt

* get hsql & hdbc tested and unmasked

== New ebuilds ==

* hxt-5.3 (has new HTTP dep, we need to decide what to do about that)

* uulib-0.9.2

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)

* darcsweb

* ghc-darcs

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

* figure out why all GHC binaries have executable stacks

* make the ghc-bin ebuild support all the same USE flags as the ghc ebuilds

* sort out the problem with hardened profiles and cflags.

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* help fix & improve cabal

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
