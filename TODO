Results of meeting 8/2/06:

== Easy ==

* add cparrott as a new developer

== High priority ==

* ghc-6.4.2 with cabal 1.1.4 and the ghc testsuite for FEATURES="test"

== Ebuild maintainance ==

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium, hs-plugins, hsshellscript, hxt

== New ebuilds ==

* hxt-5.3 (has new HTTP dep, we need to decide what to do about that)

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)

* darcsweb

* MissingH

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

* make the ghc-bin ebuild support all the same USE flags as the ghc ebuilds

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* get ghc bugs fixed upstream, send patches and get a propper fix for the exec
  stack problem.

* help fix & improve cabal:
  we need to be able to specify the libdir not just the prefix (lib/lib64)

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
