* mark ghc-6.4.1 and ghc-bin-6.4.1 stable on all supported arches

== Ebuild maintainance ==

* remove gtk2 use flag for wxhaskell, see bug #106560

* get other ebuilds marked stable on as many arches as we can test:

* new wash version

* hxt-5.3

* uulib-0.9.2

* darcsweb

* ghc-darcs

* hsql

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

* figure out why all GHC binaries have executable stacks

* make the ghc-bin ebuild support all the same USE flags as the ghc ebuilds

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* help fix & improve cabal

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)
