Results of meeting 8/2/06:

== Easy ==

* add cparrott as a new developer

== High priority ==

* ghc-6.4.2 with cabal 1.1.4 and the ghc testsuite for FEATURES="test"
  Also check:
    * does the ghcprof subst work

* test all packages with new ghc-6.4.2 & cabal-1.1.3

* test upgrading stable ghc to ghc-6.4.2

* build .tbz2 packages for ghc-bin

== Ebuild maintainance ==

* get ebuilds marked ~amd64: helium, hs-plugins, hsshellscript, hxt

== New ebuilds ==

* hxt-5.3 (has new HTTP dep, we need to decide what to do about that)

* helium-1.6 (may not work on 64-bit arches)
    An ebuild is in the overlay but it needs some more love.
    Only tested on x86.
    'hint' works with simple library and with type classes.
    The other executables only works with the simple library, type classes
    fail with:
    Using overloaded Prelude while overloading is not enabled
      Hint: Compile with --overloading, or use the simple Prelude

* darcsweb

* MissingH

* add yhc and jhc when they are ready

== Harder ==

* use the new virtuals system for virtual/ghc

* make use of the libraries profiling stuff (that's in the cabal eclass) for more lib ebuilds

* make the ghc-bin ebuild support all the same USE flags as the ghc ebuilds

== Long term & continuing projects ==

* get ghc bugs fixed upstream, send patches and get a propper fix for the exec
  stack problem.

* help fix & improve cabal:
  we need to be able to specify the libdir not just the prefix (lib/lib64)

* make sure cabal-get integrates with gentoo/portage

* improve HackPort tool

== Speculative ==

* SLOT libs

* SLOT ghc (probly not possible with current portage)

* eclectic/haskell-config (related to SLOTting ghc & libs)

* tool to help sync between portage & darcs overlay
