		Chipmunk is a fast, simple, portable, 2D physics engine
		(&lt;http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/&gt;).  This
		package the Chipmunk 5.3.4 source and Haskell bindings to
		all of its functions. It is completely self-contained.
		Please see &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HipmunkPlayground&gt;
		for a demonstration of this library.
		
		New in version 5.2.0.5:
		
		* Always compile @wrapper.c@ and fix Haddock errors
		while handling Unicode.  Thanks, Joachim Breitner.
		
		New in version 5.2.0.4:
		
		* New system-chipmunk flag.  When activated, the package will
		use the system-wide installed Chipmunk library.  Thanks,
		Joachim Breitner.
		
		New in version 5.2.0.3:
		
		* Update to Chipmunk 5.3.5 and bump dependencies to
		match GHC 7.2.1. (Thanks, S&amp;#246;nke Hahn!)
		
		* Now S&amp;#246;nke Hahn is also a Hipmunk maintainer.  Awesome!
		
		New in version 5.2.0.2:
		
		* Update to Chipmunk 5.3.4.  Note, however, that not all
		functionality available in Chipmunk 5.3.4 is here yet.  But
		the bug fixes and performance improvements are.
		
		* Fix linking bug present since Hipmunk 5.1.0.  Thanks, S&amp;#246;nke Hahn.
		
		* Correctly destroy the space in the presence of callbacks.
		
		* Workaround difficult-to-reproduce bug in Chipmunk where the
		number of contact points in an arbiter would get garbage.
		When that happens (and the garbage does look like garbage) we
		give an empty list of contact points.
